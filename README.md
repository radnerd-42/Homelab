This is an outline of things I have done for my homelab, physical and logical. The included STL files are intended for PETG or something else that can handle a bit higher temperatures than plain PLA since I run some devices that are passively cooled. They are designed for 10" mini racks, like the DeskPi Rackmate T1 at https://deskpi.com/

blank_panel.stl - This is a blank panel that can be used to block off openings, or modified as needed for holding things.

cable_guide.stl - This is used for cable management in the rack, although the 8U rack is small enough it is not always needed.

fanless_mini_pc_shelf_reinforced.stl - This is an open shelf with screw holes to mount a fanless mini-pc, allowing decent airflow around it, and reinforced on the back to prevent sagging.

mini_pc_shelf.stl - The bread and butter in my setup. This holds a mini-pc on the right or left, with a bit of space for anything else. 

power_brick_mount.stl - This is a panel that is meant to hold power bricks for the equipment in my rack with either hook and loop tape, or zip-ties.

power_strip_mount.stl - This is a panel that will take screws to mount a power strip to plug everything into.

switch_shelf.stl - This is specifically designed for switches like the NETGEAR GS308EP POE switch. Easily modified, but purpose built for now.
